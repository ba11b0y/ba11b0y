### Hello! Here’s a quick look at what I’ve been up to!

 - Recently interested in AI safety, interpretability and multi-agent security. I find presenting papers at reading groups a great exercise to learn and discuss! Here are links to slides of some of my presentations - [Secret Collusion among AI agents](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6SXc9aeWRHb2vR4w5wU_K3Cz6MzYJ0YRHJ5W7GCWJs/edit?usp=sharing), [Challenges in multi-agent systems](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k6pdh7uwsWcbb_uaNwyrOqppiajMgsTl6d9JqvRhQ9s/edit?usp=sharing)
 - Interned at [Boundary (YC W23)](https://boundaryml.com/) contributing to the type system and runtime of a new programming language/framework for AI called BAML! All my contributions are open source and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aba11b0y+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acomments-desc) if you're interested in learning more.
 - Contributed to BPFflow, an Information Flow Control(IFC) based system to prevent information leaks from eBPF programs. Accepted at eBPF workshop '25!
